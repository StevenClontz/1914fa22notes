					<title>Optimization</title>
					
					Rather than go straight into optimization, we'll give some motivation for the process first, as well as connect it to material we have already learned.
					
					<example><statement>
						Consider the function <m>f(x) = -x^2 + 6x + 11</m>.
						<ol label="a">
							<li>
								Use the methods of Section 3.3 to find the critical point of <m>f(x)</m>; give your answer as an ordered pair.
							</li>
								
							<li>
								Sketch the graph of <m>f(x)</m> to visually confirm your answer from (a).
							</li>
								
							<li>
								Now suppose that <m>f(x)</m> gives the profit (in hundred dollars) that a company makes from a certain product, when <m>x</m> thousand units are sold.  The critical point you found in (a) has a physical meaning now; what is it?
							</li>
						</ol>
					</statement></example>
					
					In the previous example, you were given the function for profit.  More often than not, however, you will need to develop the formula for yourself.
					
					<example><statement>
						 A farmer has 2400 ft of fencing and wants to fence off a rectangular field that borders a straight river.  He needs no fence along the river.  What are the dimensions of the field with the largest area?
					</statement></example>

						<title>Strategy for Optimization</title>
						<p>
							<ol>
								<li>
									Draw a picture of the situation (if possible).  Label all pieces of your diagram with a variable that will not confuse you later.
								</li>
								<li>
									Use the picture (or the description) to find equation(s) which relate to the problem.
								</li>
								<li>
									Identify the equation which will be optimized.  Use the equations from (2) and algebra to reduce the variables in the optimizing equation, and simplify.
								</li>
								<li>
									Take the derivative of your optimizing equation, set it equal to zero, and solve.
								</li>
								<li>	
									If necessary, use your answer to find the remaining pieces of information.
								</li>
							</ol>
						</p>

						The key to optimization problems is <alert>practice</alert>.  Many optimization problems follow a similar pattern, and require only slight modification from other problems.  Practice is the only way that one will learn and recognize these patterns and tricks.
					</p>
					
					<example><statement>
						A cylindrical can is to hold 1 L of oil.  Find the dimensions that will minimize the cost of the metal to manufacture the can.
					</statement></example>			
						
					<example><statement>
						Find the point on the parabola <m>y^2 = 2x</m> that is closest to the point <m>(1,4)</m>.
